# busFlow
Have you ever been frustrated waiting for a bus; not certain about when it will arrive? Have you ever wished to be all-knowing, at least in regards to the bus schedule? How much of your time (and frustration) could be saved if you knew the position of every bus  with only one press on your mobile app? 

busFlow is a smart solution for public transport which provides you with real time information about every bus in your city. 
One press and you will know: 
- at which station you should wait,
 - at which station you should get off, 
- estimated time of arrival,
 - the route you will take. 
This app can be easily implemented for TAXI service, delivery service, or any other way of transportation. You will never again come to the bus station too early, or too late. You will never again miss a bus  that was just two blocks away. Your time is priceless, and this app will save you more time. 

Our next step:
- Finish negotiations with public transport companies. 

“A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.” — Enrique Peñalosa, Ex-Mayor of Bogotá
